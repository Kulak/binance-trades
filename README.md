# binance-trades

## Overview

This is a quick GO language based application I put together to download trade history from `binance.us`.

For this to work you need to create API key in your `binance` account.  When application 1st runs it will ask for the key and its secret.  

Provided key and secret will be stored in a secure storage specific to OS you are using.

The trades are downloaded to CSV file.
